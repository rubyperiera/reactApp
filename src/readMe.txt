The react app the you can see is only when you run the API from the first time and get the data.

The only data that you get from the first API is the first name and last name and a bunch of more API to be run.

The nested API that are used to get the data like the currency and the value in the from the deals 
API was supposed to be getting form the Promise.
(you can see the part that I was trying in the coomented code in Contact.js file)

I was planning to run the nested APIs using the Promise.all in react and then accessing the data from the promises and then displaying it.


My main concerns regarding this coding test, it is very exhaustive scince you have to work with many nested API,
along with the CORs issue and not so much was mentioned in the document to exactlt do what.
